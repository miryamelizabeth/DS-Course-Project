# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The file [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/miryamelizabeth/DS-Course-Project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) contains the R script that does the following:

1.  Download the datasets from the UCI repository. The datasets contains measures from a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
2. Then, merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4.  Changes the activity names to descriptive names.
5.  Renames the columns labels of the data set with descriptive variable names.
6.  From the dataset in step 5, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
